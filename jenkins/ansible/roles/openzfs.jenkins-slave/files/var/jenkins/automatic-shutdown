# The purpose of this script is to automatically shutdown the system, to
# provide some extra assurance that we don't "leak" EC2 resources. Since
# EC2 Spot instances are being used exclusively (i.e. no other instances
# types are being used), we can lean on the fact that they will be
# automatically terminated when they are shutdown. Thus, this script is
# used as a way to try and ensure the VMs are always shutdown and
# terminated in a timely manner; e.g. in case the normal mechanism for
# doing this, fails to do so.
